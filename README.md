#Biometric Signature Interface
Biometric Signature Interface (aka `bsi-core`) is a java library for manipulating Signature/sign time series data according to [ISO/IEC 19794-7:2007](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38751)

##What can you do
* You can import from ISO
* You can export to ISO
* You can build your own ISO from a list of [`ManagedIsoPoint`](src/main/java/eu/inn/biometric/signature/managed/ManagedIsoPoint.java) captured *(Capturing will be in the scope of next projects so... stay tuned)*
